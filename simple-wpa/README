Relies on Aircrack. Edit the config file to reflect your setup.

INTERFACE -> the interface you are using ( e.g. wlan0 )
MYMAC     -> your interface's mac address
BSSID     -> the target AP's mac
ESSID     -> the target AP's name
CHANNEL   -> the channel the target AP is on

then open three console windows and run the scripts in one each, in order of their prefixed digit.
